    "In the previous sections of this chapter,\n",
    "we have designed different models for natural language processing applications,\n",
    "such as based on RNNs, CNNs, attention, and MLPs.\n",
    "These models are helpful when there is space or time constraint,\n",
    "however,\n",
    "crafting a specific model for every natural language processing task\n",
    "is practically infeasible.\n",
    "In :numref:`sec_bert`,\n",
    "we introduced a pretraining model, BERT,\n",
    "that requires minimal architecture changes\n",
    "for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "One one hand,\n",
    "at the time of its proposal,\n",
    "BERT improved the state of the art on various natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "On the other hand,\n",
    "as noted in :numref:`sec_bert-pretraining`,\n",
    "the two versions of the original BERT model\n",
    "come with 110 million and 340 million parameters.\n",
    "Thus, when there are sufficient computational resources,\n",
    "we may consider\n",
    "fine-tuning BERT for downstream natural language processing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following,\n",
    "we generalize a subset of natural language processing applications\n",
    "as sequence-level and token-level.\n",
    "On the sequence level,\n",
    "we introduce how to fine-tune BERT for single text classification and text pair classification, such as sentiment analysis and natural language inference,\n",
    "which we have already examined.\n",
    "On the token level, we will briefly introduce new applications\n",
    "such as text tagging and question answering\n",
    "and shed light on how BERT can fit in their problem settings.\n",

    "1. Suppose that we want to design a search engine algorithm for news articles. When the system receives an query (e.g., \"oil industry in coronavirus crisis\"), it should return a ranked list of news articles that are most relevant to the query. What data do you need to collect? How can we use BERT in the algorithm design?\n",
    "1. How can we leverage BERT in text generation tasks such as machine translation?\n",
