    "Text is an important example of sequence data. An article can be simply viewed as a sequence of words, or a sequence of characters. Given text data is a major data format besides images we are using in this book, this section will dedicate to explain the common preprocessing steps for text data. Such preprocessing often consists of four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load text as strings into memory.\n",
    "1. Split strings into tokens, where a token could be a word or a character. \n",
    "1. Build a vocabulary for these tokens to map them into numerical indices. \n",
    "1. Map all the tokens in data into indices for ease of feeding into models. \n",

    "## Reading the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started we load text from H. G. Wells' [Time Machine](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35). This is a fairly small corpus of just over $30,000$ words, but for the purpose of what we want to illustrate this is just fine. More realistic document collections contain many billions of words. The following function reads the dataset into a list of sentences, each sentence is a string. Here we ignore punctuation and capitalization."

    "The string type of the token is inconvenient to be used by models, which take numerical inputs. Now let's build a dictionary, often called *vocabulary* as well, to map string tokens into numerical indices starting from 0. To do so, we first count the unique tokens in all documents, called *corpus*, and then assign a numerical index to each unique token according to its frequency. Rarely appeared tokens are often removed to reduce the complexity. A token does not exist in corpus or has been removed is mapped into a special unknown (“&lt;unk&gt;”) token. We optionally add another three special tokens: “&lt;pad&gt;” a token for padding, “&lt;bos&gt;” to present the beginning for a sentence, and “&lt;eos&gt;” for the ending of a sentence."
