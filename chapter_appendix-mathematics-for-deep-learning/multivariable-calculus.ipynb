The only way the direction we pick enters into this equation is through $\\cos(\\theta)$, and thus we wish to make this cosine as negative as possible.  Now, recalling the shape of cosine, we can make this as negative as possible by making $\\cos(\\theta) = -1$ or equivalently making the angle between the gradient and our chosen direction to be $\\pi$ radians, or equivalently $180$ degrees.  The only way to achieve this is to head in the exact opposite direction:  pick $\\mathbf{v}$ to point in the exact opposite direction to $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{w}} L(\\mathbf{w})$!\n",

Thus, if we truly are at a minimum, this cannot be the case!  We can conclude that if $\\mathbf{x}_0$ is a minimum, then $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} L(\\mathbf{x}_0) = 0$.  We call points with $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} L(\\mathbf{x}_0) = 0$ *critical points*.\n",
