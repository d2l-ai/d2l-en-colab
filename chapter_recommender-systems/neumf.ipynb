    "# Neural Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Ranking\n",
    "\n",
    "This section moves beyond explicit feedback, introducing the neural collaborative filtering (NCF) framework for recommendation with implicit feedback. Implicit feedback is pervasive in recommender systems. Actions such as Clicks, buys, and watches are common implicit feedback which are easy to collect and indicative of users' preferences. The model we will introduce, titled NeuMF :cite:`He.Liao.Zhang.ea.2017`, short for neural matrix factorization, aims to address the personalized ranking task with implicit feedback. This model leverages the flexibility and non-linearity of neural networks to replace dot products of matrix factorization, aiming at enhancing the model expressiveness. In specific, this model is structured with two subnetworks including generalized matrix factorization (GMF) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) and models the interactions from two pathways instead of simple inner products. The outputs of these two networks are concatenated for the final prediction scores calculation. Unlike the rating prediction task in AutoRec, this model generates a ranked recommendation list to each user based on the implicit feedback. We will use the personalized ranking loss introduced in the last section to train this model. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The NeuMF model\n",
    "\n",
    "As aforementioned, NeuMF fuses two subnetworks. The GMF is a generic neural network version of matrix factorization where the input is the elementwise product of user and item latent factors. It consists of two neural layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{p}_u \\odot \\mathbf{q}_i \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{y}_{ui} = \\alpha(\\mathbf{h}^\\top \\mathbf{x}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\odot$ denotes the Hadamard product of vectors. $\\mathbf{P} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times k}$  and $\\mathbf{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$ corespond to user and item latent matrix respectively. $\\mathbf{p}_u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{ k}$ is the $u^\\mathrm{th}$ row of $P$ and $\\mathbf{q}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{ k}$ is the $i^\\mathrm{th}$ row of $Q$.  $\\alpha$ and $h$ denote the activation function and weight of the output layer. $\\hat{y}_{ui}$ is the prediction score of the user $u$ might give to the item $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another component of this model is MLP. To enrich model flexibility, the MLP subnetwork does not share user and item embeddings with GMF. It uses the concatenation of user and item embeddings as input. With the complicated connections and nonlinear transformations, it is capable of eastimating the intricate interactions between users and items. More precisely, the MLP subnetwork is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "z^{(1)} &= \\phi_1(\\mathbf{U}_u, \\mathbf{V}_i) = \\left[ \\mathbf{U}_u, \\mathbf{V}_i \\right] \\\\\n",
    "\\phi^{(2)}(z^{(1)})  &= \\alpha^1(\\mathbf{W}^{(2)} z^{(1)} + b^{(2)}) \\\\\n",
    "&... \\\\\n",
    "\\phi^{(L)}(z^{(L-1)}) &= \\alpha^L(\\mathbf{W}^{(L)} z^{(L-1)} + b^{(L)})) \\\\\n",
    "\\hat{y}_{ui} &= \\alpha(\\mathbf{h}^\\top\\phi^L(z^{(L)}))\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{W}^*, \\mathbf{b}^*$ and $\\alpha^*$ denote the weight matrix, bias vector, and activation function. $\\phi^*$ denotes the function of the corresponding layer. $\\mathbf{z}^*$ denotes the output of corresponding layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fuse the results of GMF and MLP, instead of simple addition, NeuMF concatenates the second last layers of two subnetworks to create a feature vector which can be passed to the further layers. Afterwards, the ouputs are projected with matrix $\\mathbf{h}$ and a sigmoid activation function. The prediction layer is formulated as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y}_{ui} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{h}^\\top[\\mathbf{x}, \\phi^L(z^{(L)})]).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure illustrates the model architecture of NeuMF.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Adding nonlinearity to matrix factorization model is beneficial for improving the model capability and effectiveness.\n",
    "* NeuMF is a combination of matrix factorization and Multilayer perceptron. The multilayer perceptron takes the concatenation of user and item embeddings as the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vary the size of latent factors. How the size of latent factors impact the model performance?\n",
    "* Vary the architectures (e.g., number of layers, number of neurons of each layer) of the MLP to check the its impact on the performance.\n",
    "* Try different optimizers, learning rate and weight decay rate.\n",
    "* Try to use hinge loss defined in the last section to optimize this model.\n",
