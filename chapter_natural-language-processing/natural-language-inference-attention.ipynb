    "# Natural Language Inference: Using Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we introduce the natural language inference task. Given the premise and hypothesis, this task identifies the inference relationship between them, including three types: entailment, contradiction and neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will discuss one of the classic tasks of natural language inference: decomposable attention model [1]. In the section `Machine translation`, we applied the attention mechanism in machine translation tasks. For these tasks, we can identify the relationship between words through attention mechanism. Decomposable attention model is enlightened by the function of attention mechanism. According to the decomposable attention model, the inference relationship between two sentences can be inferred from the corresponding relationship among the words, which can be found by the attention mechanism. Back then, this model achieved the highest rate of accuracy in Stanford natural language inference dataset, whose number of parameters are also significantly lower than other complicated models.\n",

    "## Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing the model, let’s look at the following three sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bob is in his room, but because of the thunder and lightning outside, he cannot sleep.\n",
    "- Bob is awake.\n",
    "- It is sunny outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Cannot sleep” in the first sentence and “awake” in the second sentence have the same meaning. Despite the complicated structures of the first sentence, we can also easily reach the conclusion: the second sentence is entailed in the first sentence. Similarly, as “thunder and lighting” in the first sentence and “sunny” in the third sentence are mutually exclusive, we can conclude the first sentence is contradictory to the third sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above examples, we can find a synonymous or mutually exclusive relationship between the words of premise and hypothesis, which can also conclude the inference relationship between premise and hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it naturally occurs to us that we can divide the task of identifying the inference relationship between premise and hypothesis into subproblems. Firstly, establish the relationship between each word of premise and hypothesis. This step is also known as world alignment. Then, compare the alignment relationship of every word pair to identify the inference relationship between premise and hypothesis. It also involves the three basic steps of the decomposable attention model: attention, comparison and aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attend\n",
    "\n",
    "The text sequence of premise consists of $l_A$ words. The text sequence of hypothesis consists of $l_B$ words. The dimension of word embedding is $d$. In the attention process,  the premise $\\boldsymbol{A}= (a_1,\\ldots,a_{l_A}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{l_A \\times d}$ and hypothesis $\\boldsymbol{B} = (b_1,\\ldots,b_{l_B}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{l_B \\times d}$ are input respectively. $a_i$ and $b_i$ represent the word embedding of Premise A and Hypothesis B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section of `attention mechanism`, for the seq2seq model, attention mechanism can learn about the intimate connection between the tabs of target sequence and source sequence, which is also a type of word alignment relationship in essence. For this reason, we can use the attention mechanism to learn about the word alignment relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we need to calculate the unnormalized attention weight matrix $e$ between  ${a_1,\\ldots,a_{l_A}}$  and ${b_1,\\ldots,b_{l_B}}$ . In other words, after the feedforward network calculation of $a_i$ and $b_j$, and then calculate the attention of inner product.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e_{ij} = F(a_i)^\\top F(b_j)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Next, we need to operate the sentence $A$. In this case, $\\beta_i$ is the alignment word corresponding from B to $a_i$. Generally speaking, it is obtained by the weighted array $(b_1,\\ldots,b_{l_B})$ of $a_i$. This step is known as soft alignment. Similarly, soft alignment is also necessary for sentence $B$.\n",

    "Assume $d$ is the dimension of the hidden layer and $O(d^2)$ is the time complexity of the feed-forward network. For the attention process, $O(l)$ changes of feed-forward network and time complexity $O(ld^2)$ are required. In addition, $O(l^2d)$ is the time complexity to calculate the attention of inner product.The comparison process needs $O(l)$ changes of monolayers and fully connected layers. Hence, $O(ld^2)$.In the process of aggregation, only one hidden layer and multi-layer perceptron are involved. Hence, $O(d^2)$ is the time complexity. Therefore, the overall value of time complexity is $O(l d^2+ l^2 d)$.\n",
