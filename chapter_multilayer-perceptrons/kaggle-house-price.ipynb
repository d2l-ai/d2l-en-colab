    "\n",
    "* Real data often contains a mix of different data types and needs to be preprocessed.\n",
    "* Rescaling real-valued data to zero mean and unit variance is a good default. So is replacing missing values with their mean.\n",
    "* Transforming categorical variables into indicator variables allows us to treat them like vectors.\n",
    "* We can use k-fold cross validation to select the model and adjust the hyper-parameters.\n",
    "* Logarithms are useful for relative loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit your predictions for this tutorial to Kaggle. How good are your predictions?\n",
    "1. Can you improve your model by minimizing the log-price directly? What happens if you try to predict the log price rather than the price?\n",
    "1. Is it always a good idea to replace missing values by their mean? Hint: can you construct a situation where the values are not missing at random?\n",
    "1. Find a better representation to deal with missing values. Hint: what happens if you add an indicator variable?\n",
    "1. Improve the score on Kaggle by tuning the hyperparameters through k-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "1. Improve the score by improving the model (layers, regularization, dropout).\n",
    "1. What happens if we do not standardize the continuous numerical features like we have done in this section?\n",
