    "\n",
    "For a sequence of length $T$, we compute the gradients over these $T$ timesteps in an iteration, which results in a chain of matrix-products with length  $\\mathcal{O}(T)$ during backpropagating. As mentioned in :numref:`sec_numerical_stability`, it might result in numerical instability, e.g., the gradients may either explode or vanish, when $T$ is large. Therefore, RNN models often need extra help to stabilize the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that when solving an optimization problem, we take update steps for the weights $\\mathbf{w}$ in the general direction of the negative gradient $\\mathbf{g}_t$ on a minibatch, say $\\mathbf{w} - \\eta \\cdot \\mathbf{g}_t$. Let's further assume that the objective is well behaved, i.e., it is Lipschitz continuous with constant $L$, i.e.,\n",

This is both a curse and a blessing. A curse since it limits the speed of making progress, whereas a blessing since it limits the extent to which things can go wrong if we move in the wrong direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the gradients can be quite large and the optimization algorithm may fail to converge. We could address this by reducing the learning rate $\\eta$ or by some other higher order trick. But what if we only rarely get large gradients? In this case such an approach may appear entirely unwarranted. One alternative is to clip the gradients by projecting them back to a ball of a given radius, say $\\theta$ via\n",

It also has the desirable side-effect of limiting the influence any given minibatch (and within it any given sample) can exert on the weight vectors. This bestows a certain degree of robustness to the model. Gradient clipping provides a quick fix to the gradient exploding. While it does not entire solve the problem, it is one of the many techniques to alleviate it.\n",

    "* Between sequential models you need to ensure to detach the gradients, to ensure that the automatic differentiation does not propagate effects beyond the current sample.\n",
    "* A simple RNN language model consists of an encoder, an RNN model, and a decoder.\n",
    "* Gradient clipping prevents gradient explosion (but it cannot fix vanishing gradients).\n",
    "* Perplexity calibrates model performance across different sequence length. It is the exponentiated average of the cross-entropy loss.\n",
    "* Sequential partitioning typically leads to better models.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Show that one-hot encoding is equivalent to picking a different embedding for each object.\n",
    "1. Adjust the hyperparameters to improve the perplexity.\n",
    "    * How low can you go? Adjust embeddings, hidden units, learning rate, etc.\n",
    "    * How well will it work on other books by H. G. Wells, e.g., [The War of the Worlds](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36).\n",
    "1. Modify the predict function such as to use sampling rather than picking the most likely next character.\n",
    "    * What happens?\n",
    "    * Bias the model towards more likely outputs, e.g., by sampling from $q(w_t \\mid w_{t-1}, \\ldots, w_1) \\propto p^\\alpha(w_t \\mid w_{t-1}, \\ldots, w_1)$ for $\\alpha > 1$.\n",
    "1. Run the code in this section without clipping the gradient. What happens?\n",
    "1. Change adjacent sampling so that it does not separate hidden states from the computational graph. Does the running time change? How about the accuracy?\n",
    "1. Replace the activation function used in this section with ReLU and repeat the experiments in this section.\n",
    "1. Prove that the perplexity is the inverse of the harmonic mean of the conditional word probabilities.\n",
