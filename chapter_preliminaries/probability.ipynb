    "Depending on our objective, \n",

    "And sometimes we wish not only\n",
    "to predict a specific value\n",
    "but to *quantify our uncertainty*.\n",
    "For example, given some features \n",
    "describing a patient,\n",
    "we might want to know *how likely* they are\n",
    "to suffer a heart attack in the next year. \n",
    "In unsupervised learning, \n",
    "we often care about uncertainty. \n",
    "To determine whether a set of measurements are anomalous,\n",

    "The use of probabilities to describe \n",

    "e.g., what is the *probability* \n",

    "probability provides unambiguous rules\n",
    "for how one should update their beliefs \n",

    "## A Simple Example: Tossing Coins\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we plan to toss a coin\n",
    "and want to quantify how likely\n",
    "we are to see heads (vs. tails).\n",
    "If the coin is *fair*, \n",
    "then both outcomes \n",
    "(heads and tails), \n",
    "are equally likely.\n",
    "Moreover if we plan to toss the coin $n$ times\n",
    "then the fraction of heads \n",
    "that we *expect* to see\n",
    "should exactly match\n",
    "the *expected* fraction of tails.\n",
    "One intuitive way to see this\n",
    "is by symmetry:\n",
    "for every possible outcome\n",
    "with $n_h$ heads and $n_t = (n - n_h)$ tails,\n",
    "there is an equally likely outcome\n",
    "with $n_t$ heads and $n_h$ tails.\n",
    "Note that this is only possible \n",
    "if on average we expect to see\n",
    "$1/2$ of tosses come up heads \n",
    "and $1/2$ come up tails.\n",
    "Of course, if you conduct this experiment \n",
    "many times with $n=1000000$ tosses each,\n",
    "you might never see a trial\n",
    "where $n_h = n_t$ exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, the quantity $1/2$ is called a *probability*\n",
    "and here it captures the certainty with which \n",
    "any given toss will come up heads.\n",
    "Probabilities assign scores between $0$ and $1$\n",
    "to outcomes of interest, called *events*.\n",
    "Here the event of interest is $\\textrm{heads}$\n",
    "and we denote the corresponding probability $P(\\textrm{heads})$.\n",
    "A probability of $1$ indicates absolute certainty \n",
    "(imagine a trick coin where both sides were heads)\n",
    "and a probability of $0$ indicates impossibility\n",
    "(e.g., if both sides were tails). \n",
    "The frequencies $n_h/n$ and $n_t/n$ are not probabilities\n",
    "but rather *statistics*.\n",
    "Probabilities are *theoretical* quantities \n",
    "that underly the data generating process.\n",
    "Here, the probability $1/2$ \n",
    "is a property of the coin itself.\n",
    "By contrast, statistics are *empirical* quantities\n",
    "that are computed as functions of the observed data.\n",
    "Our interests in probabilistic and statistical quantities\n",
    "are inextricably intertwined.\n",
    "We often design special statistics called *estimators*\n",
    "that, given a dataset, produce *estimates* \n",
    "of model parameters like probabilities.\n",
    "Moreover, when those estimators satisfy \n",
    "a nice property called *consistency*,\n",
    "our estimates will converge \n",
    "to the corresponding probability.\n",
    "In turn, these inferred probabilities\n",
    "tell about the likely statistical properties\n",

    "that we might encounter in the future.\n",

    "we need to (i) collect some data;\n",
    "and (ii) design an estimator.\n",
    "Data acquisition here is easy;\n",
    "we can toss the coin many times\n",
    "and record all of the outcomes.\n",
    "Formally, drawing realizations \n",
    "from some underlying random process \n",
    "is called *sampling*.\n",

    "a probabilistic model,\n",
    "generating synthetic data,\n",
    "running a statistical estimator,\n",
    "empirically assessing convergence,\n",
    "and reporting error metrics (checking the deviation). \n",
    "However, to go much further,\n",
    "we will need to be more precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with randomness, \n",
    "we denote the set of possible outcomes $\\mathcal{S}$\n",
    "and call it the *sample space* or *outcome space*.\n",
    "Here, each element is a distinct possible *outcome*.\n",
    "In the case of rolling a single coin,\n",
    "$\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{tails}\\}$.\n",
    "For a single die, $\\mathcal{S} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\n",
    "When flipping two coins, we have four possible outcomes:\n",
    "$\\{(\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{heads}), (\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{tails}), (\\textrm{tails}, \\textrm{heads}),  (\\textrm{tails}, \\textrm{tails})\\}$.\n",
    "*Events* are subsets of the sample space.\n",
    "For instance, the event \"the first coin toss comes up heads\"\n",
    "corresponds to the set $\\{(\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{heads}), (\\textrm{heads}, \\textrm{tails})\\}$.\n",
    "Whenever the outcome $z$ of a random experiment satisfies\n",
    "$z \\in \\mathcal{A}$, then event $\\mathcal{A}$ has occurred.\n",
    "For a single roll of a die, we could define the events \n",
    "\"seeing a $5$\" ($\\mathcal{A} = \\{5\\}$) \n",
    "and \"seeing an odd number\"  ($\\mathcal{B} = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$).\n",
    "In this case, if the die came up `5`,\n",
    "we would say that both $A$ and $B$ occurred.\n",
    "On the other hand, if $z = 3$, \n",
    "then $\\mathcal{A}$ did not occur \n",
    "but $\\mathcal{B}$ did.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A *probability* function maps events \n",
    "onto real values ${P: \\mathcal{A} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow [0,1]}$.\n",
    "The probability of an event $\\mathcal{A}$ \n",
    "in the given sample space $\\mathcal{S}$,\n",
    "denoted $P(\\mathcal{A})$,\n",
    "satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$ is a non-negative real number, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{A}) \\geq 0$;\n",
    "* The probability of the entire sample space is $1$, i.e., $P(\\mathcal{S}) = 1$;\n",
    "* For any countable sequence of events $\\mathcal{A}_1, \\mathcal{A}_2, \\ldots$ that are *mutually exclusive* ($\\mathcal{A}_i \\cap \\mathcal{A}_j = \\emptyset$ for all $i \\neq j$), the probability that any of them happens is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities, i.e., $P(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{A}_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} P(\\mathcal{A}_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These axioms of probability theory,\n",
    "proposed by :cite:`Kolmogorov.1933`,\n",
    "can be applied to rapidly derive a number of important consequences.\n",
    "For instance, it follows immediately\n",
    "that the probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
    "*or* its complement $\\mathcal{A}'$ occurring is 1 \n",
    "(because $\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{A}' = \\mathcal{S}$).\n",
    "We can also prove that $P(\\emptyset) = 0$\n",
    "because $1 = P(\\mathcal{S} \\cup \\mathcal{S}') = P(\\mathcal{S} \\cup \\emptyset) = P(\\mathcal{S}) + P(\\emptyset) = 1 + P(\\emptyset)$.\n",
    "Consequently, the probability of any event $\\mathcal{A}$\n",
    "*and* its complement $\\mathcal{A}'$ occurring simultaneously \n",
    "is $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{A}') = 0$.\n",
    "Informally, this tells us that impossible events\n",
    "have zero probability of occurring. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When we spoke about events like the roll of a die\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, there are many things to be uncertain about!\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the value of a label given an input.\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the estimated value of a parameter.\n",
    "We can even be uncertain about whether data arriving at deployment\n",
    "is even from the same distribution as the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By *aleatoric uncertainty*, we denote that uncertainty \n",
    "that is intrinsic to the problem, \n",
    "and due to genuine randomness \n",
    "unaccounted for by the observed variables.\n",
    "By *epistemic uncertainty*, we denote uncertainty\n",
    "over a model's parameters, the sort of uncertainty\n",
    "that we can hope to reduce by collecting more data.\n",
    "We might have epistemic uncertainty \n",
    "concerning the probability \n",
    "that a coin turns up heads,\n",
    "but even once we know this probability,\n",
    "we are left with aleatoric uncertainty \n",
    "about the outcome of any future toss.\n",
    "No matter how long we watch someone tossing a fair coin, \n",
    "we will never be more or less than 50% certain \n",
    "that the next toss will come up heads.\n",
    "These terms owe to literature in mechanical modeling,\n",
    "(see e.g., :cite:`Der-Kiureghian.Ditlevsen.2009` for a review on this aspect of [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)).\n",
    "It's worth noting that these terms constitute a slight abuse of language.\n",
    "The term *epistemic* refers to anything concerning *knowledge*\n",
    "and thus in the philosophical sense, all uncertainty is epistemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that sampling data from some unknown probability distribution \n",
    "can provide us with information that can be used to estimate\n",
    "the parameters of the data generating distribution.\n",
    "That said, the rate at which this is possible can be quite slow. \n",
    "In our coin tossing example (and many others) \n",
    "we can do no better than to design estimators\n",
    "that converge at a rate of $1/\\sqrt{n}$,\n",
    "where $n$ is the sample size (e.g., the number of tosses). \n",
    "This means that by going from 10 to 1000 observations (usually a very achievable task) \n",
    "we see a tenfold reduction of uncertainty, \n",
    "whereas the next 1000 observations help comparatively little, \n",
    "offering only a 1.41 times reduction. \n",
    "This is a persistent feature of machine learning: \n",
    "while there are often easy gains, it takes a very large amount of data, \n",
    "and often with it an enormous amount of computation to make even further gains. \n",
    "For an empirical review of this fact for large scale language models see :cite:`Revels.Lubin.Papamarkou.2016`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also sharpened our language and tools for statistical modeling. \n",
    "In the process of that we learned about conditional probabilities \n",
    "and about one of the most important equations in statistics---Bayes' theorem. \n",
    "It is an effective tool for decoupling information conveyed by data \n",
    "through a likelihood term $P(B|A)$ that addresses \n",
    "how well observations $B$ match a choice of parameters $A$,\n",
    "and a prior probability $P(A)$ which governs how plausible \n",
    "a particular choice of $A$ was in the first place.\n",
    "In particular, we saw how this rule can be applied\n",
    "to assign probabilities to diagnoses,\n",
    "based on the efficacy of the test *and* \n",
    "the prevalence of the disease itself (i.e., our prior).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we introduced a first set of nontrivial questions \n",
    "about the effect of a specific probability distribution,\n",
    "namely expectations and variances. \n",
    "While there are many more than just linear and quadratic \n",
    "expectations for a probability distribution, \n",
    "these two already provide a good deal of knowledge \n",
    "about the possible behavior of the distribution. \n",
    "For instance, [Chebyshev's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality)\n",
    "states that $P(|X - \\mu| \\geq k \\sigma) \\leq 1/k^2$, \n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the expectation, $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution,\n",

    "1. Assume that we have a sequence of random variables, say $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $B$ only depends on $A$, and $C$ only depends on $B$, can you simplify the joint probability $P(A, B, C)$? Hint: this is a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).\n",
    "1. In :numref:`subsec_probability_hiv_app`, assume that the outcomes of the two tests are not independent. In particular assume that either test on its own has a false positive rate of 10% and a false negative rate of 1%. That is, assume that $P(D =1|H=0) = 0.1$ and that $P(D = 0|H=1) = 0.01$. Moreover, assume that for $H = 1$ (infected) the test outcomes are conditionally independent, i.e., that $P(D_1, D_2|H=1) = P(D_1|H=1) P(D_2|H=1)$ but that for healthy patients the outcomes are coupled via $P(D_1 = D_2 = 1|H=0) = 0.02$. \n",
