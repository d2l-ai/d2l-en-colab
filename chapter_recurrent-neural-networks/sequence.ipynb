    "Up until now, we have focused on models whose inputs\n",

    "The main change of perspective when developing models\n",
    "capable of processing sequences is that we now\n",
    "focus on inputs that consist of an ordered list\n",
    "of feature vectors $\\mathbf{x}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}_T$,\n",
    "where each feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_t$ is\n",

    "lying in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some datasets consist of a single massive sequence.\n",
    "Consider, for example, the extremely long streams\n",

    "In such cases, we might create training datasets\n",
    "by randomly sampling subsequences of some predetermined length.\n",
    "More often, our data arrives as a collection of sequences.\n",
    "Consider the following examples:\n",
    "(i) a collection of documents,\n",
    "each represented as its own sequence of words,\n",
    "and each having its own length $T_i$;\n",
    "(ii) sequence representation of\n",

    "based on sequentially structured inputs\n",
    "(e.g., machine translation or video captioning).\n",

    "## Sequence Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, especially when working with language,\n",
    "we wish to estimate the joint probability\n",
    "of an entire sequence.\n",
    "This is a common task when working with sequences\n",
    "composed of discrete *tokens*, such as words.\n",
    "Generally, these estimated functions are called *sequence models*\n",
    "and for natural language data, they are called *language models*.\n",
    "The field of sequence modeling has been driven so much by natural language processing,\n",
    "that we often describe sequence models as \"language models\",\n",
    "even when dealing with non-language data.\n",
    "Language models prove useful for all sorts of reasons.\n",
    "Sometimes we want to evaluate the likelihood of sentences.\n",
    "For example, we might wish to compare\n",
    "the naturalness of two candidate outputs\n",
    "generated by a machine translation system\n",
    "or by a speech recognition system.\n",
    "But language modeling gives us not only\n",
    "the capacity to *evaluate* likelihood,\n",
    "but the ability to *sample* sequences,\n",
    "and even to optimize for the most likely sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "While language modeling might not, at first glance, look\n",
    "like an autoregressive problem,\n",
    "we can reduce language modeling to autoregressive prediction\n",
    "by decomposing the joint density  of a sequence $p(x_1, \\ldots, x_T)$\n",
    "into the product of conditional densities\n",
    "in a left-to-right fashion\n",
    "by applying the chain rule of probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_1, \\ldots, x_T) = P(x_1) \\prod_{t=2}^T P(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_1).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we are working with discrete signals such as words,\n",
    "then the autoregressive model must be a probabilistic classifier,\n",
    "outputting a full probability distribution\n",
    "over the vocabulary for whatever word will come next,\n",
    "given the leftwards context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov Models\n",
    ":label:`subsec_markov-models`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose that we wish to employ the strategy mentioned above,\n",
    "where we condition only on the $\\tau$ previous time steps,\n",
    "i.e., $x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_{t-\\tau}$, rather than\n",
    "the entire sequence history $x_{t-1}, \\ldots, x_1$.\n",
    "Whenever we can throw away the history\n",
    "beyond the previous $\\tau$ steps\n",
    "without any loss in predictive power,\n",
    "we say that the sequence satisfies a *Markov condition*,\n",
    "i.e., *that the future is conditionally independent of the past,\n",
    "given the recent history*.\n",
    "When $\\tau = 1$, we say that the data is characterized\n",
    "by a *first-order Markov model*,\n",
    "and when $\\tau = k$, we say that the data is characterized\n",
    "by a $k^{\\textrm{th}}$-order Markov model.\n",
    "For when the first-order Markov condition holds ($\\tau = 1$)\n",
    "the factorization of our joint probability becomes a product\n",
    "of probabilities of each word given the previous *word*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_1, \\ldots, x_T) = P(x_1) \\prod_{t=2}^T P(x_t \\mid x_{t-1}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We often find it useful to work with models that proceed\n",
    "as though a Markov condition were satisfied,\n",
    "even when we know that this is only *approximately* true.\n",
    "With real text documents we continue to gain information\n",
    "as we include more and more leftwards context.\n",
    "But these gains diminish rapidly.\n",
    "Thus, sometimes we compromise, obviating computational and statistical difficulties\n",
    "by training models whose validity depends\n",
    "on a $k^{\\textrm{th}}$-order Markov condition.\n",
    "Even today's massive RNN- and Transformer-based language models\n",
    "seldom incorporate more than thousands of words of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With discrete data, a true Markov model\n",
    "simply counts the number of times\n",
    "that each word has occurred in each context, producing\n",
    "the relative frequency estimate of $P(x_t \\mid x_{t-1})$.\n",
    "Whenever the data assumes only discrete values\n",
    "(as in language),\n",
    "the most likely sequence of words can be computed efficiently\n",
    "using dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Order of Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why we represented\n",
    "the factorization of a text sequence $P(x_1, \\ldots, x_T)$\n",
    "as a left-to-right chain of conditional probabilities.\n",
    "Why not right-to-left or some other, seemingly random order?\n",
    "In principle, there is nothing wrong with unfolding\n",
    "$P(x_1, \\ldots, x_T)$ in reverse order.\n",
    "The result is a valid factorization:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(x_1, \\ldots, x_T) = P(x_T) \\prod_{t=T-1}^1 P(x_t \\mid x_{t+1}, \\ldots, x_T).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are many reasons why factorizing text\n",
    "in the same direction in which we read it\n",
    "(left-to-right for most languages,\n",
    "but right-to-left for Arabic and Hebrew)\n",
    "is preferred for the task of language modeling.\n",
    "First, this is just a more natural direction for us to think about.\n",
    "After all we all read text every day,\n",
    "and this process is guided by our ability\n",
    "to anticipate which words and phrases\n",
    "are likely to come next.\n",
    "Just think of how many times you have completed\n",
    "someone else's sentence.\n",
    "Thus, even if we had no other reason to prefer such in-order decodings,\n",
    "they would be useful if only because we have better intuitions\n",
    "for what should be likely when predicting in this order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, by factorizing in order,\n",
    "we can assign probabilities to arbitrarily long sequences\n",
    "using the same language model.\n",
    "To convert a probability over steps $1$ through $t$\n",
    "into one that extends to word $t+1$ we simply\n",
    "multiply by the conditional probability\n",
    "of the additional token given the previous ones:\n",
    "$P(x_{t+1}, \\ldots, x_1) = P(x_{t}, \\ldots, x_1) \\cdot P(x_{t+1} \\mid x_{t}, \\ldots, x_1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we have stronger predictive models\n",
    "for predicting adjacent words than\n",
    "words at arbitrary other locations.\n",
    "While all orders of factorization are valid,\n",
    "they do not necessarily all represent equally easy\n",
    "predictive modeling problems.\n",
    "This is true not only for language,\n",
    "but for other kinds of data as well,\n",
    "e.g., when the data is causally structured.\n",
    "For example, we believe that future events cannot influence the past.\n",
    "Hence, if we change $x_t$, we may be able to influence\n",
    "what happens for $x_{t+1}$ going forward but not the converse.\n",
    "That is, if we change $x_t$, the distribution over past events will not change.\n",
    "In some contexts, this makes it easier to predict $P(x_{t+1} \\mid x_t)$\n",
    "than to predict $P(x_t \\mid x_{t+1})$.\n",
    "For instance, in some cases, we can find $x_{t+1} = f(x_t) + \\epsilon$\n",
    "for some additive noise $\\epsilon$,\n",
    "whereas the converse is not true :cite:`Hoyer.Janzing.Mooij.ea.2009`.\n",
    "This is great news, since it is typically the forward direction\n",
    "that we are interested in estimating.\n",
    "The book by :citet:`Peters.Janzing.Scholkopf.2017` contains more on this topic.\n",
    "We barely scratch the surface of it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There is quite a difference in difficulty\n",
    "between interpolation and extrapolation.\n",
    "Consequently, if you have a sequence, always respect\n",
    "the temporal order of the data when training,\n",
    "i.e., never train on future data.\n",
    "Given this kind of data,\n",
    "sequence models require specialized statistical tools for estimation.\n",
    "Two popular choices are autoregressive models\n",
    "and latent-variable autoregressive models.\n",
    "For causal models (e.g., time going forward),\n",
    "estimating the forward direction is typically\n",
    "a lot easier than the reverse direction.\n",
    "For an observed sequence up to time step $t$,\n",
    "its predicted output at time step $t+k$\n",
    "is the $k$*-step-ahead prediction*.\n",
    "As we predict further in time by increasing $k$,\n",
    "the errors accumulate and the quality of the prediction degrades,\n",
    "often dramatically.\n",

    "    1. How many past observations would you need if there was no noise? Hint: you can write $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ as a differential equation.\n",
    "    1. Can you incorporate older observations while keeping the total number of features constant? Does this improve accuracy? Why?\n",
    "    1. Change the neural network architecture and evaluate the performance. You may train the new model with more epochs. What do you observe?\n",
    "1. An investor wants to find a good security to buy.\n",
    "   They look at past returns to decide which one is likely to do well.\n",

    "1. Does causality also apply to text? To which extent?\n",
    "1. Give an example for when a latent autoregressive model\n",
    "   might be needed to capture the dynamic of the data.\n"
