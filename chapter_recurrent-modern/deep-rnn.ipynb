    "Up to now, we only discussed recurrent neural networks with a single unidirectional hidden layer. In it the specific functional form of how latent variables and observations interact was rather arbitrary. This is not a big problem as long as we have enough flexibility to model different types of interactions. With a single layer, however, this can be quite challenging. In the case of the perceptron, we fixed this problem by adding more layers. Within RNNs this is a bit more tricky, since we first need to decide how and where to add extra nonlinearity. Our discussion below focuses primarily on LSTMs, but it applies to other sequence models, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We could add extra nonlinearity to the gating mechanisms. That is, instead of using a single perceptron we could use multiple layers. This leaves the *mechanism* of the LSTM unchanged. Instead it makes it more sophisticated. This would make sense if we were led to believe that the LSTM mechanism describes some form of universal truth of how latent variable autoregressive models work.\n",
    "* We could stack multiple layers of LSTMs on top of each other. This results in a mechanism that is more flexible, due to the combination of several simple layers. In particular, data might be relevant at different levels of the stack. For instance, we might want to keep high-level data about financial market conditions (bear or bull market) available, whereas at a lower level we only record shorter-term temporal dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond all this abstract discussion it is probably easiest to understand the family of models we are interested in by reviewing :numref:`fig_deep_rnn`. It describes a deep recurrent neural network with $L$ hidden layers. Each hidden state is continuously passed to both the next timestep of the current layer and the current timestep of the next layer.\n",

    "At timestep $t$ we assume that we have a minibatch $\\mathbf{X}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ (number of examples: $n$, number of inputs: $d$). The hidden state of hidden layer $\\ell$ ($\\ell=1,\\ldots, T$) is $\\mathbf{H}_t^{(\\ell)}  \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h}$ (number of hidden units: $h$), the output layer variable is $\\mathbf{O}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times q}$ (number of outputs: $q$) and a hidden layer activation function $f_l$ for layer $l$. We compute the hidden state of layer $1$ as before, using $\\mathbf{X}_t$ as input. For all subsequent layers, the hidden state of the previous layer is used in its place.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{O}_t = g \\left(\\mathbf{H}_t^{(L)}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with multilayer perceptrons, the number of hidden layers $L$ and number of hidden units $h$ are hyper parameters. In particular, we can pick a regular RNN, a GRU, or an LSTM to implement the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concise Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately many of the logistical details required to implement multiple layers of an RNN are readily available in Gluon. To keep things simple we only illustrate the implementation using such built-in functionality. The code is very similar to the one we used previously for LSTMs. In fact, the only difference is that we specify the number of layers explicitly rather than picking the default of a single layer. Let's begin by importing the appropriate modules and loading data."

    "* In deep recurrent neural networks, hidden state information is passed to the next timestep of the current layer and the current timestep of the next layer.\n",
