    "\n",
    "We already know that the transposed convolution layer can magnify a feature map. In image processing, sometimes we need to magnify the image, i.e., upsampling. There are many methods for upsampling, and one common method is bilinear interpolation. Simply speaking, in order to get the pixel of the output image at the coordinates $(x, y)$, the coordinates are first mapped to the coordinates of the input image $(x', y')$. This can be done based on the ratio of the size of thee input to the size of the output. The mapped values $x'$ and $y'$ are usually real numbers. Then, we find the four pixels closest to the coordinate $(x', y')$ on the input image. Finally, the pixels of the output image at coordinates $(x, y)$ are calculated based on these four pixels on the input image and their relative distances to $(x', y')$. Upsampling by bilinear interpolation can be implemented by transposed convolution layer of the convolution kernel constructed using the following `bilinear_kernel` function. Due to space limitations, we only give the implementation of the `bilinear_kernel` function and will not discuss the principles of the algorithm."
