    "With softmax regression, we can train models for multi-category classification.\n",
    "The training loop is very similar to that in linear regression:\n",
    "retrieve and read data, define models and loss functions,\n",
    "then train models using optimization algorithms.\n",
    "As you will soon find out, most common deep learning models\n",
    "have similar training procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In this section, we directly implemented the softmax function based on the mathematical definition of the softmax operation. What problems might this cause (hint: try to calculate the size of $\\exp(50)$)?\n",
    "1. The function `cross_entropy` in this section is implemented according to the definition of the cross-entropy loss function.  What could be the problem with this implementation (hint: consider the domain of the logarithm)?\n",
    "1. What solutions you can think of to fix the two problems above?\n",
    "1. Is it always a good idea to return the most likely label. E.g. would you do this for medical diagnosis?\n",
    "1. Assume that we want to use softmax regression to predict the next word based on some features. What are some problems that might arise from a large vocabulary?\n",
