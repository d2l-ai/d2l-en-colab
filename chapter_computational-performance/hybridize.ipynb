    "Python is an *interpreted language*. When evaluating the above `fancy_func` function it performs the operations making up the function's body *in sequence*. That is, it will evaluate `e = add(a, b)` and store the results as variable `e`, thereby changing the program's state. The next two statements `f = add(c, d)` and `g = add(e, f)` will be executed similarly, performing additions and storing the results as variables. :numref:`fig_compute_graph` illustrates the flow of data.\n",

On the one hand, even if the `add` function is repeatedly called throughout `fancy_func`, Python will execute the three function calls individually. If these are executed, say, on a GPU (or even on multiple GPUs), the overhead arising from the Python interpreter can become overwhelming. Moreover, it will need to save the variable values of `e` and `f` until all the statements in `fancy_func` have been executed. This is because we do not know whether the variables `e` and `f` will be used by other parts of the program after the statements `e = add(a, b)` and `f = add(c, d)` are executed.\n",

    "Second, a compiler might optimize and rewrite the above code into `print((1 + 2) + (3 + 4))` or even `print(10)`. This is possible since a compiler gets to see the full code before turning it into machine instructions. For instance, it can release memory (or never allocate it) whenever a variable is no longer needed. Or it can transform the code entirely into an equivalent piece.\n",

    "## Hybridizing the `Sequential` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get a feel for how hybridization works is to consider deep networks with multiple layers. Conventionally the Python interpreter will need to execute the code for all layers to generate an instruction that can then be forwarded to a CPU or a GPU. For a single (fast) computing device this does not cause any major issues. On the other hand, if we use an advanced 8-GPU server such as an AWS P3dn.24xlarge instance Python will struggle to keep all GPUs busy. The single-threaded Python interpreter becomes the bottleneck here. Let's see how we can address this for significant parts of the code by replacing `Sequential` with `HybridSequential`. We begin by defining a simple MLP.\n"

    "This is quite different from what we saw previously. All print statements, as defined in `hybrid_forward`, are omitted. Indeed, after hybridization the execution of `net(x)` does not involve the Python interpreter any longer. This means that any spurious Python code is omitted (such as print statements) in favor of a much more streamlined execution and better performance. Instead, MXNet directly calls the C++ backend. Also note that some functions are not supported in the `symbol` module (e.g.,  `asnumpy`) and operations in-place such as `a += b` and `a[:] = a + b` must be rewritten as `a = a + b`. Nonetheless, compilation of models is worth the effort whenever speed matters. The benefit can range from small percentage points to more than twice the speed, depending on the complexity of the model, the speed of the CPU, and the speed and number of GPUs.\n"
