    "When we first started talking about neural networks,\n",
    "we introduced linear models with a single output.\n",
    "Here, the entire model consists of just a single neuron.\n",
    "By itself, a single neuron takes some set of inputs,\n",
    "generates a corresponding (*scalar*) output,\n",
    "and has a set of associated parameters that can be updated\n",
    "to optimize some objective function of interest.\n",
    "Then, once we started thinking about networks with multiple outputs,\n",
    "we leveraged vectorized arithmetic,\n",
    "we showed how we could use linear algebra\n",
    "to efficiently express an entire *layer* of neurons.\n",
    "Layers too expect some inputs, generate corresponding outputs,\n",
    "and are described by a set of tunable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we worked through softmax regression,\n",
    "a single *layer* was itself *the model*.\n",
    "However, when we subsequently introduced multilayer perceptrons,\n",
    "we developed models consisting of multiple layers.\n",
    "One interesting property of multilayer neural networks\n",
    "is that the *entire model* and its *constituent layers*\n",
    "share the same basic structure.\n",
    "The model takes the true inputs (as stated in the problem formulation),\n",
    "outputs predictions of the true outputs,\n",
    "and possesses parameters (the combined set of all parameters from all layers)\n",
    "Likewise any individual constituent layer in a multilayer perceptron\n",
    "ingests inputs (supplied by the previous layer)\n",
    "generates outputs (which form the inputs to the subsequent layer),\n",
    "and possesses a set of tunable parameters\n",
    "that are updated with respect to the ultimate objective\n",
    "(using the signal that flows backwards through the subsequent layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "While you might think that neurons, layers, and models\n",
    "give us enough abstractions to go about our business,\n",
    "it turns out that we will often want to express our model\n",
    "in terms of components that are larger than an individual layer.\n",
    "For example, when designing models, like ResNet-152,\n",
    "which possess hundreds (152, thus the name) of layers,\n",
    "implementing the network one layer at a time can grow tedious.\n",
    "Moreover, this concern is not just hypothetical---such deep networks\n",
    "dominate numerous application areas, especially when training data is abundant.\n",
    "For example the ResNet architecture mentioned above\n",
    "won the 2015 ImageNet and COCO computer vision competitions\n",
    "for both recognition and detection :cite:`He.Zhang.Ren.ea.2016`.\n",
    "Deep networks with many layers arranged into components\n",
    "with various repeating patterns are now ubiquitous in other domains\n",
    "including natural language processing and speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate the implementation of networks consisting of components\n",
    "of arbitrary complexity, we introduce a new flexible concept:\n",
    "a neural network *block*.\n",
    "A block could describe a single neuron,\n",
    "a high-dimensional layer,\n",
    "or an arbitrarily-complex component consisting of multiple layers.\n",
    "From a software development, a `Block` is a class.\n",
    "Any subclass of `Block` must define a method called `forward`\n",
    "that transforms its input into output,\n",
    "and must store any necessary parameters.\n",
    "Note that some Blocks do not require any parameters at all!\n",
    "Finally a `Block` must possess a `backward` method,\n",
    "for purposes of calculating gradients.\n",
    "Fortunately, due to some behind-the-scenes magic\n",
    "supplied by the `autograd` package\n",
    "(introduced in :numref:`chap_preliminaries`)\n",
    "when defining our own `Block` typically requires\n",
    "only that we worry about parameters and the `forward` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of working with the `Block` abstraction is that\n",
    "they can be combined into larger artifacts, often recursively,\n",
    "e.g., as illustrated in :numref:`fig_blocks`.\n",

    "The following code generates a network\n",
    "with one fully-connected hidden layer containing 256 units\n",
    "followed by a ReLU activation,\n",
    "and then another fully-connected layer\n",
    "consisting of 10 units (with no activation function).\n",
    "Because there are no more layers,\n",
    "this last 10-unit layer is regarded as the *output layer*\n",

    "1. Initialize these parameters as needed.\n",

    "In this `FancyMLP` model, we used constant weight `Rand_weight` (note that it is not a model parameter), performed a matrix multiplication operation (`np.dot<`), and reused the *same* `Dense` layer. Note that this is very different from using two dense layers with different sets of parameters. Instead, we used the same network twice. Quite often in deep networks one also says that the parameters are *tied* when one wants to express that multiple parts of a network share the same parameters. Let's see what happens if we construct it and feed data through it."

Obviously the example below resembles more a chimera, or less charitably, a [Rube Goldberg Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine). That said, it combines examples for building a block from individual blocks, which in turn, may be blocks themselves. Furthermore, we can even combine multiple strategies inside the same forward function. To demonstrate this, here's the network."

    "The avid reader is probably starting to worry about the efficiency of this. After all, we have lots of dictionary lookups, code execution, and lots of other Pythonic things going on in what is supposed to be a high performance deep learning library. The problems of Python's [Global Interpreter Lock](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock) are well known. In the context of deep learning it means that we have a super fast GPU (or multiple of them) which might have to wait until a puny single CPU core running Python gets a chance to tell it what to do next. This is clearly awful and there are many ways around it. The best way to speed up Python is by avoiding it altogether.\n",
