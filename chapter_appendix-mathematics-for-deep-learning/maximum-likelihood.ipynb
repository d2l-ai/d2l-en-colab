    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly encountered way of thinking in machine learning is the maximum likelihood point of view.  This is the concept that when working with a probabilistic model with unknown parameters, the parameters which make the data have the highest probability are the most likely ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Maximum Likelihood Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "This has a Bayesian interpretation which can be helpful to think about.  Suppose that we have a model with parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ and a collection of data points $X$.  For concreteness, we can imagine that $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is a single value representing the probability that a coin comes up heads when flipped, and $X$ is a sequence of independent coin flips.  We will look at this example in depth later.\n",

    "\n",
    "The expression $P(X)$, a parameter agnostic probability of generating the data, does not depend on $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ at all, and so can be dropped without changing the best choice of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$.  Similarly, we may now posit that we have no prior assumption on which set of parameters are better than any others, so we may declare that $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ does not depend on theta either!  This, for instance, makes sense in our coin flipping example where the probability it comes up heads could be any value in $[0,1]$ without any prior belief it is fair or not (often referred to as an *uninformative prior*).  Thus we see that our application of Bayes' rule shows that our best choice of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$:\n",

    "### A Concrete Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in a concrete example.  Suppose that we have a single parameter $\\theta$ representing the probability that a coin flip is heads.  Then the probability of getting a tails is $1-\\theta$, and so if our observed data $X$ is a sequence with $n_H$ heads and $n_T$ tails, we can use the fact that independent probabilities multiply to see that \n",

Indeed, if we said verbally, \"I flipped 13 coins, and 9 came up heads, what is our best guess for the probability that the coin comes us heads?, \" everyone would correctly guess $9/13$.  What this maximum likelihood method will give us is a way to get that number from first principals in a way that will generalize to vastly more complex situations.\n",
