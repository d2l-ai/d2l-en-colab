    ":label:`sec_language_model`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In :numref:`sec_text_preprocessing`, we see how to map text data into tokens, and these tokens can be viewed as a time series of discrete observations. Assuming the tokens in a text of length $T$ are in turn $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_T$, then, in the discrete time series, $x_t$($1 \\leq t \\leq T$) can be considered as the output or label of timestep $t$. Given such a sequence, the goal of a language model is to estimate the probability\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_T).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are incredibly useful. For instance, an ideal language model would be able to generate natural text just on its own, simply by drawing one word at a time $w_t \\sim p(w_t \\mid w_{t-1}, \\ldots, w_1)$. Quite unlike the monkey using a typewriter, all text emerging from such a model would pass as natural language, e.g., English text. Furthermore, it would be sufficient for generating a meaningful dialog, simply by conditioning the text on previous dialog fragments. Clearly we are still very far from designing such a system, since it would need to *understand* the text rather than just generate grammatically sensible content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless language models are of great service even in their limited form. For instance, the phrases \"to recognize speech\" and \"to wreck a nice beach\" sound very similar. This can cause ambiguity in speech recognition, ambiguity that is easily resolved through a language model which rejects the second translation as outlandish. Likewise, in a document summarization algorithm it is worth while knowing that \"dog bites man\" is much more frequent than \"man bites dog\", or that \"let's eat grandma\" is a rather disturbing statement, whereas \"let's eat, grandma\" is much more benign.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating a Language Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious question is how we should model a document, or even a sequence of words. We can take recourse to the analysis we applied to sequence models in the previous section. Let's start by applying basic probability rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_T) = p(w_1) \\prod_{t=2}^T p(w_t  \\mid  w_1, \\ldots, w_{t-1}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the probability of a text sequence containing four tokens consisting of words and punctuation would be given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\mathrm{Statistics}, \\mathrm{is}, \\mathrm{fun}, \\mathrm{.}) =  p(\\mathrm{Statistics}) p(\\mathrm{is}  \\mid  \\mathrm{Statistics}) p(\\mathrm{fun}  \\mid  \\mathrm{Statistics}, \\mathrm{is}) p(\\mathrm{.}  \\mid  \\mathrm{Statistics}, \\mathrm{is}, \\mathrm{fun}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compute the language model, we need to calculate the\n",
    "probability of words and the conditional probability of a word given\n",
    "the previous few words, i.e., language model parameters. Here, we\n",
    "assume that the training dataset is a large text corpus, such as all\n",
    "Wikipedia entries, [Project Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gutenberg), or all text posted online on the\n",
    "web. The probability of words can be calculated from the relative word\n",
    "frequency of a given word in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $p(\\mathrm{Statistics})$ can be calculated as the\n",
    "probability of any sentence starting with the word \"statistics\". A\n",
    "slightly less accurate approach would be to count all occurrences of\n",
    "the word \"statistics\" and divide it by the total number of words in\n",
    "the corpus. This works fairly well, particularly for frequent\n",
    "words. Moving on, we could attempt to estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{p}(\\mathrm{is} \\mid \\mathrm{Statistics}) = \\frac{n(\\mathrm{Statistics~is})}{n(\\mathrm{Statistics})}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $n(w)$ and $n(w, w')$ are the number of occurrences of singletons\n",
    "and pairs of words respectively. Unfortunately, estimating the\n",
    "probability of a word pair is somewhat more difficult, since the\n",
    "occurrences of \"Statistics is\" are a lot less frequent. In\n",
    "particular, for some unusual word combinations it may be tricky to\n",
    "find enough occurrences to get accurate estimates. Things take a turn for the worse for 3-word combinations and beyond. There will be many plausible 3-word combinations that we likely will not see in our dataset. Unless we provide some solution to give such word combinations nonzero weight, we will not be able to use these as a language model. If the dataset is small or if the words are very rare, we might not find even a single one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common strategy is to perform some form of Laplace smoothing. We already\n",
    "encountered this in our discussion of\n",
    "naive Bayes in :numref:`sec_naive_bayes` where the solution was to\n",

    "above is a rather primitive variant of what is Kneser-Ney smoothing\n",
    "and Bayesian nonparametrics can accomplish. See e.g., :cite:`Wood.Gasthaus.Archambeau.ea.2011` for more detail of how to accomplish\n",
    "this. Unfortunately, models like this get unwieldy rather quickly\n",
    "for the following reasons. First, we need to store all counts.\n",
    "Second, this entirely ignores the meaning of the words. For\n",
    "instance, *\"cat\"* and *\"feline\"* should occur in related contexts.\n",
    "It is quite difficult to adjust such models to additional contexts,\n",

Let's apply this to language modeling. A distribution over sequences satisfies the Markov property of first order if $p(w_{t+1} \\mid w_t, \\ldots, w_1) = p(w_{t+1} \\mid w_t)$.

Picking just a random set of initial positions is no good either since it does not guarantee uniform coverage of the array. For instance, if we pick $n​$ elements at random out of a set of $n​$ with random replacement, the probability for a particular element not being picked is $(1-1/n)^n \\to e^{-1}​$. This means that we cannot expect uniform coverage this way. Even randomly permuting a set of all offsets does not offer good guarantees.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Language models are an important technology for natural language processing.\n",
    "* $n$-grams provide a convenient model for dealing with long sequences by truncating the dependence.\n",
    "* Long sequences suffer from the problem that they occur very rarely or never.\n",
    "* Zipf's law governs the word distribution for not only unigrams but also the other $n$-grams.\n",
    "* There is a lot of structure but not enough frequency to deal with infrequent word combinations efficiently via Laplace smoothing.\n",
    "* The main choices for sequence partitioning are picking between consecutive and random sequences.\n",
    "* Given the overall document length, it is usually acceptable to be slightly wasteful with the documents and discard half-empty minibatches.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose there are $100,000$ words in the training dataset. How much word frequency and multi-word adjacent frequency does a four-gram need to store?\n",
    "1. Review the smoothed probability estimates. Why are they not accurate? Hint: we are dealing with a contiguous sequence rather than singletons.\n",
    "1. How would you model a dialogue?\n",
    "1. Estimate the exponent of Zipf's law for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams.\n",
    "1. What other minibatch data sampling methods can you think of?\n",
    "1. Why is it a good idea to have a random offset?\n",
    "    * Does it really lead to a perfectly uniform distribution over the sequences on the document?\n",
    "    * What would you have to do to make things even more uniform?\n",
    "1. If we want a sequence example to be a complete sentence, what kinds of problems does this introduce in minibatch sampling? Why would we want to do this anyway?\n",
