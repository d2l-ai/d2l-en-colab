Given a training dataset, we consider the loss of our neural network on this dataset, which we will write as $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{w})$.  \n",

    "This function is extraordinarily complex, encoding the performance of all possible models of the given architecture on this dataset, so it is nearly impossible to tell what set of weights $\\mathbf{w}$ will minimize the loss.

    "The question then becomes something that on the surface is no easier: how do we find the direction which makes the weights decrease as quickly as possible?  To dig into this, let's first examine the case with only a single weight: $L(\\mathbf{w}) = L(x)$ for a single real value $x$. \n",

It is a gift of mathematics that we can generalize the above derivatives and compute more complex derivatives like finding the derivative of $f(x) = \\log\\left(1+(x-1)^{10}\\right)$.  As was mentioned in :numref:`sec_calculus`, the key to doing so is to codify what happens when we take functions and combine them in various ways, most importantly: sums, products, and compositions.\n",
