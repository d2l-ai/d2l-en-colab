    "# Natural language inference and the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section “Text Sentiment Classification: Using Recurrent Neural Networks”, we discussed the model of using recurrent neural networks for text classification. Text classification task aims to identify the category of any given text sequence. But in actual scenarios, sometimes we need two given sentences in order to classify the relationship between them, i.e. sentence pair classification. For example, on a shopping website, the online customer service system needs to decide whether users’ questions have the same meanings as the existing ones in the knowledge base, which is the task of identifying the relationship between two sentences. In this case, we can not solve the issue by using the model of categorizing the single text sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are about to analyze the relationship between the two sentence classification. The most typical example of these tasks is natural language inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Natural language inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language inference is also known as text entailment. Natural language inference is an important issue of natural language processing. On one hand, semantic relations exit among the seemingly isolated texts. On the other hand, semantic relations of texts enable machine to truly understand and utilize the semantic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, the task of natural language inference refers to identifying the inference relationship between hypothesis and premise. There are three different types of inference relationships. 1. Entailment, i.e. People think the semanteme of hypothesis can be inferred from that of premise. 2. Contradiction, i.e. People believe that hypothesis is false according to the semanteme of premise. 3. Neutral, i.e. People can not decide the semanteme of hypothesis according to that of the premise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this task inputs a sentence pair of premise and hypothesis, natural language inference is to classify the sentence pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first example is entailment. “Showing affection” in the hypothesis can be inferred from “hugging one another” in the premise.\n",
    "> Premise：Two blond women are hugging one another.\n",
    "> Hypothesis：There are women showing affection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example is contradiction. The premise mentions what a person inspects. It can be inferred that “sleeping” can not happen simultaneously in the hypothesis.\n",
    "> Premise：A man inspects the uniform of a figure in some East Asian country.\n",
    "> Hypothesis：The man is sleeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third example is neutrality. There is no relationship between premise and hypothesis.\n",
    "> Premise：A boy is jumping on skateboard in the middle of a red bridge.\n",
    "> Hypothesis：The boy skates down the sidewalk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stanford natural language inference(SNLI) dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used datasets in natural language inference include Stanford natural language inference(SNLI) and multiple natural language inference (MultiNLI) dataset. SNLI has more than 500,000 manually written English sentence pairs, which are divided into three types of relationships: entailment, contradiction and neutrality. MultiNLI is the upgraded version of SNLI. However, the difference between them is that MultiNLI dataset also involves relevant spoken and written texts. For this reason, it has more variations in comparison with Stanford natural language inference dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will use Stanford natural language inference dataset. To make better use of this dataset, we need to input the packages or modules needed for the experiment."
