    "Python is an interpreted language. When evaluating `fancy_func` it performs the operations making up the function's body *in sequence*. That is, it will evaluate `e = add(a, b)` and it will store the results as variable `e`, thereby changing the program's state. The next two statements `f = add(c, d)` and `g = add(e, f)` will be excecuted similarly, performing additions and storing the results as variables. :numref:`fig_compute_graph` illustrates the flow of data.\n",

    "Although imperative programming is convenient, it may be inefficient. On one hand, even if the `add` function is repeatedly called throughout `fancy_func`, Python will execute the three function calls individually. If these are executed, say, on a GPU (or even on multiple GPUs), the overhead arising from the Python interpreter can become overwhelming. Moreover, it will need to save the variable values of `e` and `f` until all the statements in `fancy_func` have been executed. This is because we do not know whether the variables `e` and `f` will be used by other parts of the program after the statements `e = add(a, b)` and `f = add(c, d)` have been executed.\n",

It usually involves the following steps:\n",

    "1. Define the operations to be executed.\n",
    "1. Compile the operations into an executable program.\n",
    "1. Provide the required inputs and call the compiled program for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for a significant amount of optimization. First off, we can skip the Python interpreter in many cases, thus removing a performance bottleneck that can become significant on multiple fast GPUs paired with a single Python thread on a CPU. Secondly, a compiler might optimize and rewrite the above code into `print((1 + 2) + (3 + 4))` or even `print(10)`. This is possible since a compiler gets to see the full code before turning it into machine instructions. For instance, it can release memory (or never allocate it) whenever a variable is no longer needed. Or it can transform the code entirely into an equivalent piece. To get a better idea consider the following simulation of imperative programming (it's Python after all) below."

    "The differences between imperative (interpreted) programming and symbolic programming are as follows:\n",

    "* Imperative programming is easier. When imperative programming is used in Python, the majority of the code is straightforward and easy to write. It is also easier to debug imperative programming code. This is because it is easier to obtain and print all relevant intermediate variable values, or use Python’s built-in debugging tools.\n",
    "* Symbolic programming is more efficient and easier to port. It makes it easier to optimize the code during compilation, while also having the ability to port the program into a format independent of Python. This allows the program to be run in a non-Python environment, thus avoiding any potential performance issues related to the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hybrid Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically most deep learning frameworks choose between an imperative or a symbolic approach. For example, Theano,  TensorFlow (inspired by the latter), Keras and CNTK formulate models symbolically. Conversely Chainer and PyTorch take an imperative approach. An imperative mode was added TensorFlow 2.0 (via Eiger) and Keras in later revisions. When designing Gluon, developers considered whether it would be possible to combine the benefits of both programming models. This led to a hybrid model that lets users develop and debug using pure imperative programming, while having the ability to convert most programs into symbolic programs to be run when product-level computing performance and deployment are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this means that we build models using either the `HybridBlock` or the `HybridSequential` and `HybridConcurrent` classes. By default, they are executed in the same way `Block` or `Sequential` and `Concurrent` classes are executed in imperative programming. `HybridSequential` is a subclass of `HybridBlock` (just like `Sequential` subclasses `Block`). When the `hybridize` function is called, Gluon compiles the model into the form used in symbolic programming. This allows one to optimize the compute-intensive components without sacrifices in the way a model is implemented. We will illustrate the benefits below, focusing on sequential models and blocks only (the concurrent composition works analogously).\n",
    "\n",
    "## HybridSequential\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to get a feel for how hybridization works is to consider deep networks with multiple layers. Conventionally the Python interpreter will need to execute the code for all layers to generate an instruction that can then be forwarded to a CPU or a GPU. For a single (fast) compute device this doesn't cause any major issues. On the other hand, if we use an advanced 8-GPU server such as an AWS P3dn.24xlarge instance Python will struggle to keep all GPUs busy. The single-threaded Python interpreter becomes the bottleneck here. Let's see how we can address this for significant parts of the code by replacing `Sequential` by `HybridSequential`. We begin by defining a simple MLP."

Indeed, after hybridization the execution of `net(x)` does not involve the Python interpreter any longer. This means that any spurious Python code is omitted (such as print statements) in favor of a much more streamlined execution and better performance. Instead, MXNet directly calls the C++ backend. Also note that some functions are not supported in the `symbol` module (like `asnumpy`) and operations in-place like `a += b` and `a[:] = a + b` must be rewritten as `a = a + b`. Nonetheless, compilation of models is worth the effort whenever speed matters. The benefit can range from small percentage points to more than twice the speed, depending on the complexity of the model, the speed of the CPU and the speed and number of GPUs.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imperative programming makes it easy to design new models since it is possible to write code with control flow and the ability to use a large amount of the Python software ecosystem.\n",
    "* Symbolic programming requires that we specify the program and compile it before executing it. The benefit is improved performance.\n",
    "* MXNet is able to combine the advantages of both approaches as needed.\n",
    "* Models constructed by the `HybridSequential` and `HybridBlock` classes are able to convert imperative programs into symbolic programs by calling the `hybridize` method.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Design a network using the `HybridConcurrent` class. Alternatively look at :ref:`sec_googlenet` for a network to compose.\n",
    "1. Add `x.asnumpy()` to the first line of the `hybrid_forward` function of the HybridNet class in this section. Execute the code and observe the errors you encounter. Why do they happen?\n",
    "1. What happens if we add control flow, i.e. the Python statements `if` and `for` in the `hybrid_forward` function?\n",
    "1. Review the models that interest you in the previous chapters and use the HybridBlock class or HybridSequential class to implement them.\n",
