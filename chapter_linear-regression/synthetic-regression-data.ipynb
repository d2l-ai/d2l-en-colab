    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Data loaders are a convenient way of abstracting out \n",
    "the process of loading and manipulating data. \n",
    "This way the same machine learning *algorithm* \n",
    "is capable of processing many different types and sources of data \n",
    "without the need for modification. \n",
    "One of the nice things about data loaders \n",
    "is that they can be composed. \n",
    "For instance, we might be loading images \n",
    "and then have a postprocessing filter \n",
    "that crops them or modifies them in other ways. \n",
    "As such, data loaders can be used \n",
    "to describe an entire data processing pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the model itself, the two-dimensional linear model \n",
    "is about the simplest we might encounter. \n",
    "It lets us test out the accuracy of regression models \n",
    "without worrying about having insufficient amounts of data \n",
    "or an underdetermined system of equations. \n",
    "We will put this to good use in the next section.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What will happen if the number of examples cannot be divided by the batch size. How would you change this behavior by specifying a different argument by using the framework's API?\n",
    "1. Suppose that we want to generate a huge dataset, where both the size of the parameter vector `w` and the number of examples `num_examples` are large.\n",
    "    1. What happens if we cannot hold all data in memory?\n",
    "    1. How would you shuffle the data if it is held on disk? Your task is to design an *efficient* algorithm that does not require too many random reads or writes. Hint: [pseudorandom permutation generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_permutation) allow you to design a reshuffle without the need to store the permutation table explicitly :cite:`Naor.Reingold.1999`. \n",
