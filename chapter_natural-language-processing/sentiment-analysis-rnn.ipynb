    "\n",
    "* Text classification transforms a sequence of text of indefinite length into a category of text. This is a downstream application of word embedding.\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increase the number of epochs. What accuracy rate can you achieve on the training and testing datasets? What about trying to re-tune other hyper-parameters?\n",
    "1. Will using larger pre-trained word vectors, such as 300-dimensional GloVe word vectors, improve classification accuracy?\n",
    "1. Can we improve the classification accuracy by using the spaCy word tokenization tool? You need to install spaCy: `pip install spacy` and install the English package: `python -m spacy download en`. In the code, first import spacy: `import spacy`. Then, load the spacy English package: `spacy_en = spacy.load('en')`. Finally, define the function `def tokenizer(text): return [tok.text for tok in spacy_en.tokenizer(text)]` and replace the original `tokenizer` function. It should be noted that GloVe's word vector uses \"-\" to connect each word when storing noun phrases. For example, the phrase \"new york\" is represented as \"new-york\" in GloVe. After using spaCy tokenization, \"new york\" may be stored as \"new york\".\n",
