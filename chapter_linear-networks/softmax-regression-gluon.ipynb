    "and $z_j$ is the $j^\\mathrm{th}$ element of the input\n",

    "If some of the $z_i$ are very large (i.e., very positive),\n",
    "then $e^{z_i}$ might be larger than the largest number\n",
    "we can have for certain types of ``float`` (i.e., overflow).\n",
    "This would make the denominator (and/or numerator) ``inf`` \n",
