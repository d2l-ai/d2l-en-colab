    "## Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When we spoke about events like the roll of a die\n",
    "coming up odds or the first coin toss coming up heads,\n",
    "we were invoking the idea of a *random variable*.\n",
    "Formally, random variables are mappings\n",
    "from an underlying sample space\n",
    "to a set of (possibly many) values.\n",
    "You might wonder how a random variable\n",
    "is different from the sample space,\n",
    "since both are collections of outcomes.\n",
    "Importantly, random variables can be much coarser\n",
    "than the raw sample space.\n",
    "We can define a binary random variable like \"greater than 0.5\"\n",
    "even when the underlying sample space is infinite,\n",
    "e.g., points on the line segment between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "Additionally, multiple random variables\n",
    "can share the same underlying sample space.\n",
    "For example \"whether my home alarm goes off\"\n",
    "and \"whether my house was burgled\"\n",
    "are both binary random variables\n",
    "that share an underlying sample space.\n",
    "Consequently, knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
    "can tell us something about the likely value of another random variable.\n",
    "Knowing that the alarm went off,\n",
    "we might suspect that the house was likely burgled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value taken by a random variable corresponds\n",
    "to a subset of the underlying sample space.\n",
    "Thus the occurrence where the random variable $X$\n",
    "takes value $v$, denoted by $X=v$, is an *event*\n",
    "and $P(X=v)$ denotes its probability.\n",
    "Sometimes this notation can get clunky,\n",
    "and we can abuse notation when the context is clear.\n",
    "For example, we might use $P(X)$ to refer broadly\n",
    "to the *distribution* of $X$, i.e.,\n",
    "the function that tells us the probability\n",
    "that $X$ takes any given value.\n",
    "Other times we write expressions\n",
    "like $P(X,Y) = P(X) P(Y)$,\n",
    "as a shorthand to express a statement\n",
    "that is true for all of the values\n",
    "that the random variables $X$ and $Y$ can take, i.e.,\n",
    "for all $i,j$ it holds that $P(X=i \\textrm{ and } Y=j) = P(X=i)P(Y=j)$.\n",
    "Other times, we abuse notation by writing\n",
    "$P(v)$ when the random variable is clear from the context.\n",
    "Since an event in probability theory is a set of outcomes from the sample space,\n",
    "we can specify a range of values for a random variable to take.\n",
    "For example, $P(1 \\leq X \\leq 3)$ denotes the probability of the event $\\{1 \\leq X \\leq 3\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a subtle difference\n",
    "between *discrete* random variables,\n",
    "like flips of a coin or tosses of a die,\n",
    "and *continuous* ones,\n",
    "like the weight and the height of a person\n",
    "sampled at random from the population.\n",
    "In this case we seldom really care about\n",
    "someone's exact height.\n",
    "Moreover, if we took precise enough measurements,\n",
    "we would find that no two people on the planet\n",
    "have the exact same height.\n",
    "In fact, with fine enough measurements,\n",
    "you would never have the same height\n",
    "when you wake up and when you go to sleep.\n",
    "There is little point in asking about\n",
    "the exact probability that someone\n",
    "is 1.801392782910287192 meters tall.\n",
    "Instead, we typically care more about being able to say\n",
    "whether someone's height falls into a given interval,\n",
    "say between 1.79 and 1.81 meters.\n",
    "In these cases we work with probability *densities*.\n",
    "The height of exactly 1.80 meters\n",
    "has no probability, but nonzero density.\n",
    "To work out the probability assigned to an interval,\n",
    "we must take an *integral* of the density\n",

    "\n",

    "Most of machine learning\n",

    "Each random variable would represent\n",
    "the (unknown) value of a different attribute.\n",
    "Whenever we sample an individual from the population,\n",
    "we observe a realization of each of the random variables.\n",

    "correspond to subsets of the sample space\n",
    "that could be overlapping, partially overlapping,\n",
    "or entirely disjoint,\n",
    "knowing the value taken by one random variable\n",
    "can cause us to update our beliefs\n",
    "about which values of another random variable are likely.\n",
    "If a patient walks into a hospital\n",
    "and we observe that they\n",
    "are having trouble breathing\n",

    "and a perfectly ordinary sense of smell.\n",

    "\n",

    "The probability function that assigns\n",
    "probabilities to each of these combinations\n",
    "(e.g. $A=a$ and $B=b$)\n",
    "is called the *joint probability* function\n",
    "and simply returns the probability assigned\n",
    "to the intersection of the corresponding subsets\n",
    "of the sample space.\n",
    "The *joint probability* assigned to the event\n",
    "where random variables $A$ and $B$\n",
    "take values $a$ and $b$, respectively,\n",

    "$$P(A=a, B=b) \\leq P(A=a) \\textrm{ and } P(A=a, B=b) \\leq P(B = b),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "since for $A=a$ and $B=b$ to happen,\n",
    "$A=a$ has to happen *and* $B=b$ also has to happen.\n",
    "Interestingly, the joint probability\n",
    "tells us all that we can know about these\n",
    "random variables in a probabilistic sense,\n",

    "useful quantities, including recovering the\n",

    "The ratio $\\frac{P(A=a, B=b)}{P(A=a)} \\leq 1$\n",

    "The assumption of both tests being conditionally independent of each other\n",
    "was crucial for our ability to generate a more accurate estimate.\n",
    "Take the extreme case where we run the same test twice.\n",
    "In this situation we would expect the same outcome both times,\n",
    "hence no additional insight is gained from running the same test again.\n",
    "The astute reader might have noticed that the diagnosis behaved\n",

    "## Expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, making decisions requires not just looking\n",
    "at the probabilities assigned to individual events\n",
    "but composing them together into useful aggregates\n",
    "that can provide us with guidance.\n",
    "For example, when random variables take continuous scalar values,\n",
    "we often care about knowing what value to expect *on average*.\n",
    "This quantity is formally called an *expectation*.\n",
    "If we are making investments,\n",
    "the first quantity of interest\n",
    "might be the return we can expect,\n",
    "averaging over all the possible outcomes\n",
    "(and weighting by the appropriate probabilities).\n",
    "For instance, say that with 50% probability,\n",
    "an investment might fail altogether,\n",
    "with 40% probability it might provide a 2$\\times$ return,\n",
    "and with 10% probability it might provide a 10$\\times$ return 10$\\times$.\n",
    "To calculate the expected return,\n",
    "we sum over all returns, multiplying each\n",
    "by the probability that they will occur.\n",
    "This yields the expectation\n",
    "$0.5 \\cdot 0 + 0.4 \\cdot 2 + 0.1 \\cdot 10 = 1.8$.\n",
    "Hence the expected return is 1.8$\\times$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the *expectation* (or average)\n",
    "of the random variable $X$ is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = E_{x \\sim P}[x] = \\sum_{x} x P(X = x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, for densities we obtain $E[X] = \\int x \\;dp(x)$.\n",
    "Sometimes we are interested in the expected value\n",
    "of some function of $x$.\n",
    "We can calculate these expectations as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_{x \\sim P}[f(x)] = \\sum_x f(x) P(x) \\textrm{ and } E_{x \\sim P}[f(x)] = \\int f(x) p(x) \\;dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for discrete probabilities and densities, respectively.\n",
    "Returning to the investment example from above,\n",
    "$f$ might be the *utility* (happiness)\n",
    "associated with the return.\n",
    "Behavior economists have long noted\n",
    "that people associate greater disutility\n",
    "with losing money than the utility gained\n",
    "from earning one dollar relative to their baseline.\n",
    "Moreover, the value of money tends to be sub-linear.\n",
    "Possessing 100k dollars versus zero dollars\n",
    "can make the difference between paying the rent,\n",
    "eating well, and enjoying quality healthcare\n",
    "versus suffering through homelessness.\n",
    "On the other hand, the gains due to possessing\n",
    "200k versus 100k are less dramatic.\n",
    "Reasoning like this motivates the cliché\n",
    "that \"the utility of money is logarithmic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If  the utility associated with a total loss were $-1$,\n",
    "and the utilities associated with returns of $1$, $2$, and $10$\n",
    "were $1$, $2$ and $4$, respectively,\n",
    "then the expected happiness of investing\n",
    "would be $0.5 \\cdot (-1) + 0.4 \\cdot 2 + 0.1 \\cdot 4 = 0.7$\n",
    "(an expected loss of utility of 30%).\n",
    "If indeed this were your utility function,\n",
    "you might be best off keeping the money in the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "For financial decisions,\n",
    "we might also want to measure\n",
    "how *risky* an investment is.\n",
    "Here, we care not just about the expected value\n",
    "but how much the actual values tend to *vary*\n",
    "relative to this value.\n",
    "Note that we cannot just take\n",
    "the expectation of the difference\n",
    "between the actual and expected values.\n",
    "This is because the expectation of a difference\n",
    "is the difference of the expectations,\n",
    "i.e., $E[X - E[X]] = E[X] - E[E[X]] = 0$.\n",
    "However, we can look at the expectation\n",
    "of any non-negative function of this difference.\n",
    "The *variance* of a random variable is calculated by looking\n",
    "at the expected value of the *squared* differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{Var}[X] = E\\left[(X - E[X])^2\\right] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the equality follows by expanding\n",
    "$(X - E[X])^2 = X^2 - 2 X E[X] + E[X]^2$\n",
    "and taking expectations for each term.\n",
    "The square root of the variance is another\n",
    "useful quantity called the *standard deviation*.\n",
    "While this and the variance\n",
    "convey the same information (either can be calculated from the other),\n",
    "the standard deviation has the nice property\n",
    "that it is expressed in the same units\n",
    "as the original quantity represented\n",
    "by the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the variance of a function\n",
    "of a random variable\n",
    "is defined analogously as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{Var}_{x \\sim P}[f(x)] = E_{x \\sim P}[f^2(x)] - E_{x \\sim P}[f(x)]^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our investment example,\n",
    "we can now compute the variance of the investment.\n",
    "It is given by $0.5 \\cdot 0 + 0.4 \\cdot 2^2 + 0.1 \\cdot 10^2 - 1.8^2 = 8.36$.\n",
    "For all intents and purposes this is a risky investment.\n",
    "Note that by mathematical convention mean and variance\n",
    "are often referenced as $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$.\n",
    "This is particularly the case whenever we use it\n",
    "to parametrize a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way as we introduced expectations\n",
    "and variance for *scalar* random variables,\n",
    "we can do so for vector-valued ones.\n",
    "Expectations are easy, since we can apply them elementwise.\n",
    "For instance, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} E_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{x}]$\n",
    "has coordinates $\\mu_i = E_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim P}[x_i]$.\n",
    "*Covariances* are more complicated.\n",
    "We define them by taking expectations of the *outer product*\n",
    "of the difference between random variables and their mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\stackrel{\\textrm{def}}{=} \\textrm{Cov}_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim P}[\\mathbf{x}] = E_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim P}\\left[(\\mathbf{x} - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}) (\\mathbf{x} - \\boldsymbol{\\mu})^\\top\\right].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is referred to as the covariance matrix.\n",
    "An easy way to see its effect is to consider some vector $\\mathbf{v}$\n",
    "of the same size as $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "It follows that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\mathbf{v} = E_{\\mathbf{x} \\sim P}\\left[\\mathbf{v}^\\top(\\mathbf{x} - \\boldsymbol{\\mu}) (\\mathbf{x} - \\boldsymbol{\\mu})^\\top \\mathbf{v}\\right] = \\textrm{Var}_{x \\sim P}[\\mathbf{v}^\\top \\mathbf{x}].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ allows us to compute the variance\n",
    "for any linear function of $\\mathbf{x}$\n",
    "by a simple matrix multiplication.\n",
    "The off-diagonal elements tell us how correlated the coordinates are:\n",
    "a value of 0 means no correlation,\n",
    "where a larger positive value\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, there are many things to be uncertain about!\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the value of a label given an input.\n",
    "We can be uncertain about the estimated value of a parameter.\n",
    "We can even be uncertain about whether data arriving at deployment\n",
    "is even from the same distribution as the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By *aleatoric uncertainty*, we mean uncertainty\n",
    "that is intrinsic to the problem,\n",
    "and due to genuine randomness\n",
    "unaccounted for by the observed variables.\n",
    "By *epistemic uncertainty*, we mean uncertainty\n",
    "over a model's parameters, the sort of uncertainty\n",
    "that we can hope to reduce by collecting more data.\n",
    "We might have epistemic uncertainty\n",
    "concerning the probability\n",
    "that a coin turns up heads,\n",
    "but even once we know this probability,\n",
    "we are left with aleatoric uncertainty\n",
    "about the outcome of any future toss.\n",
    "No matter how long we watch someone tossing a fair coin,\n",
    "we will never be more or less than 50% certain\n",
    "that the next toss will come up heads.\n",
    "These terms come from mechanical modeling,\n",
    "(see e.g., :citet:`Der-Kiureghian.Ditlevsen.2009` for a review on this aspect of [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)).\n",
    "It is worth noting, however, that these terms constitute a slight abuse of language.\n",
    "The term *epistemic* refers to anything concerning *knowledge*\n",
    "and thus, in the philosophical sense, all uncertainty is epistemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that sampling data from some unknown probability distribution\n",
    "can provide us with information that can be used to estimate\n",
    "the parameters of the data generating distribution.\n",
    "That said, the rate at which this is possible can be quite slow.\n",
    "In our coin tossing example (and many others)\n",
    "we can do no better than to design estimators\n",
    "that converge at a rate of $1/\\sqrt{n}$,\n",
    "where $n$ is the sample size (e.g., the number of tosses).\n",
    "This means that by going from 10 to 1000 observations (usually a very achievable task)\n",
    "we see a tenfold reduction of uncertainty,\n",
    "whereas the next 1000 observations help comparatively little,\n",
    "offering only a 1.41 times reduction.\n",
    "This is a persistent feature of machine learning:\n",
    "while there are often easy gains, it takes a very large amount of data,\n",
    "and often with it an enormous amount of computation, to make further gains.\n",
    "For an empirical review of this fact for large scale language models see :citet:`Revels.Lubin.Papamarkou.2016`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also sharpened our language and tools for statistical modeling.\n",
    "In the process of that we learned about conditional probabilities\n",
    "and about one of the most important equations in statistics---Bayes' theorem.\n",
    "It is an effective tool for decoupling information conveyed by data\n",
    "through a likelihood term $P(B \\mid A)$ that addresses\n",
    "how well observations $B$ match a choice of parameters $A$,\n",
    "and a prior probability $P(A)$ which governs how plausible\n",
    "a particular choice of $A$ was in the first place.\n",
    "In particular, we saw how this rule can be applied\n",
    "to assign probabilities to diagnoses,\n",
    "based on the efficacy of the test *and*\n",
    "the prevalence of the disease itself (i.e., our prior).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we introduced a first set of nontrivial questions\n",
    "about the effect of a specific probability distribution,\n",
    "namely expectations and variances.\n",
    "While there are many more than just linear and quadratic\n",
    "expectations for a probability distribution,\n",
    "these two already provide a good deal of knowledge\n",
    "about the possible behavior of the distribution.\n",
    "For instance, [Chebyshev's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality)\n",
    "states that $P(|X - \\mu| \\geq k \\sigma) \\leq 1/k^2$,\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the expectation, $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the distribution,\n",
    "and $k > 1$ is a confidence parameter of our choosing.\n",
    "It tells us that draws from a distribution lie\n",
    "with at least 50% probability\n",

    "1. Given two events with probability $P(\\mathcal{A})$ and $P(\\mathcal{B})$, compute upper and lower bounds on $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{B})$ and $P(\\mathcal{A} \\cap \\mathcal{B})$. Hint: graph the situation using a [Venn diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram).\n",
    "1. Assume that we have a sequence of random variables, say $A$, $B$, and $C$, where $B$ only depends on $A$, and $C$ only depends on $B$, can you simplify the joint probability $P(A, B, C)$? Hint: this is a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).\n",
    "1. In :numref:`subsec_probability_hiv_app`, assume that the outcomes of the two tests are not independent. In particular assume that either test on its own has a false positive rate of 10% and a false negative rate of 1%. That is, assume that $P(D =1 \\mid H=0) = 0.1$ and that $P(D = 0 \\mid H=1) = 0.01$. Moreover, assume that for $H = 1$ (infected) the test outcomes are conditionally independent, i.e., that $P(D_1, D_2 \\mid H=1) = P(D_1 \\mid H=1) P(D_2 \\mid H=1)$ but that for healthy patients the outcomes are coupled via $P(D_1 = D_2 = 1 \\mid H=0) = 0.02$.\n",
