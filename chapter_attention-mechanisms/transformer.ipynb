    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapters, we have covered major neural network architectures such as convolution neural networks (CNNs) and  recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Let's recap their pros and cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CNNs** are easy to parallelize at a layer but cannot capture the variable-length sequential dependency very well. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **RNNs** are able to capture the long-range, variable-length sequential information, but suffer from inability to parallelize within a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine the advantages from both CNNs and RNNs, :cite:`Vaswani.Shazeer.Parmar.ea.2017` designed a novel architecture using the attention mechanism.\n",
    "This architecture, which is called as *Transformer*, achieves parallelization by capturing recurrence sequence with attention and at the same time encodes each item's position in the sequence. As a result, Transformer leads to a compatible model with significantly shorter training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the seq2seq model in :numref:`sec_seq2seq`, Transformer is also based on the encoder-decoder architecture. However,  Transformer differs to the former by replacing the\n",
    "recurrent layers in seq2seq with *multi-head attention* layers, incorporating the position-wise information through *position encoding*, and applying *layer normalization*. \n",
    "We  compare  Transformer  and seq2seq  side-by-side in :numref:`fig_transformer`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these two models are similar to each other: the source sequence embeddings are fed into $n$ repeated blocks. The outputs of the last block are then used as attention memory for the decoder.  The target sequence embeddings are similarly fed into $n$ repeated blocks in the decoder, and the final outputs are obtained by applying a dense layer with vocabulary size to the last block's outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, Transformer differs from the seq2seq with attention model in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transformer block**: a recurrent layer in seq2seq is replaced by a *Transformer block*. This block contains a *multi-head attention* layer and a network with two *position-wise feed-forward network* layers for the encoder. For the decoder, another multi-head attention layer is used to take the encoder state.\n",
    "1. **Add and norm**: the inputs and outputs of both the multi-head attention layer or the position-wise feed-forward network, are processed by two \"add and norm\" layer that contains a residual structure and a *layer normalization* layer.\n",
    "1. **Position encoding**: since the self-attention layer does not distinguish the item order in a sequence, a positional encoding layer is used to add sequential information into each sequence item.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the rest of this section, we will equip you with each new component introduced by Transformer, and get you up and running to construct a machine translation model."

    "## Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the discussion of the *multi-head attention* layer, let's quick express the *self-attention* architecture. The self-attention model is a normal attention model, with its query, its key, and its value being copied exactly the same from each item of the sequential inputs. As we illustrate in :numref:`fig_self_attention`, self-attention outputs a same-length sequential output for each input item. Compared with a recurrent layer, output items of a self-attention layer can be computed in parallel and, therefore, it is easy to obtain a highly-efficient implementation.\n",

    "\n",
    ":label:`fig_self_attention`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The *multi-head attention* layer consists of $h$ parallel self-attention layers, each one is called a *head*. For each head, before feeding into the attention layer, we project the queries, keys, and values with three dense layers with hidden sizes $p_q$, $p_k$, and $p_v$, respectively. The outputs of these $h$ attention heads are concatenated and then processed by a final dense layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Multi-head attention](../img/multi-head-attention.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the dimension for a query, a key, and a value are $d_q$, $d_k$, and $d_v$, respectively. Then, for each head $i=1,\\ldots, h$, we can train learnable parameters \n",
    "$\\mathbf W_q^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb R^{p_q\\times d_q}$,\n",
    "$\\mathbf W_k^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb R^{p_k\\times d_k}$,\n",
    "and $\\mathbf W_v^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb R^{p_v\\times d_v}$. Therefore, the output for each head is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf o^{(i)} = \\textrm{attention}(\\mathbf W_q^{(i)}\\mathbf q, \\mathbf W_k^{(i)}\\mathbf k,\\mathbf W_v^{(i)}\\mathbf v),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\textrm{attention}$ can be any attention layer, such as the `DotProductAttention` and `MLPAttention` as we introduced in :label:`sec_attention`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the output with length $p_v$ from each of the $h$ attention heads are concatenated to be an output of length $h p_v$, which is then passed the final dense layer with $d_o$ hidden units. The weights of this dense layer can be denoted by $\\mathbf W_o\\in\\mathbb R^{d_o\\times h p_v}$. As a result, the multi-head attention output will be\n",

    "$$\\mathbf o = \\mathbf W_o \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf o^{(1)}\\\\\\vdots\\\\\\mathbf o^{(h)}\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can implement the multi-head attention. Assume that the multi-head attention contain the number heads `num_heads` $=h$, the hidden size `hidden_size` $=p_q=p_k=p_v$ are the same for the query,  key, and value dense layers. In addition, since the multi-head attention keeps the same dimensionality between its input and its output, we have the output feature size $d_o =$ `hidden_size` as well."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Transformer model is based on the encoder-decoder architecture. \n",
    "* Multi-head attention layer contains $h$ parallel attention layers.\n",
    "* Position-wise feed-forward network consists of two dense layers that apply to the last dimension.\n",
    "* Layer normalization differs from batch normalization by normalizing along the last dimension (the feature dimension) instead of the first (batch size) dimension.\n",
    "* Positional encoding is the only place that adds positional information to the Transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try a larger size of epochs and compare the loss between seq2seq model and Transformer model.\n",
    "1. Can you think of any other benefit of positional encoding?\n",
    "1. Compare layer normalization and batch normalization, when shall we apply which?\n",
