We add an MLP attention layer (`MLPAttention`) which has the same hidden size as the LSTM layer in the decoder. Then we initialize the state of the decoder by passing three items from the encoder:\n",

The attention model's output is then concatenated with the input embedding vector to feed into the RNN layer.
