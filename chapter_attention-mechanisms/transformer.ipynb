    "In previous chapters, we have covered major neural network architectures such as convolution neural networks (CNNs) and  recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Let's recap their pros and cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CNNs** are easy to parallelize at a layer but cannot capture the variable-length sequential dependency very well. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **RNNs** are able to capture the long-range, variable-length sequential information, but suffer from inability to parallelize within a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine the advantages from both CNNs and RNNs, :cite:`Vaswani.Shazeer.Parmar.ea.2017` designed a novel architecture using the attention mechanism.\n",
    "This architecture, which is called as *Transformer*, achieves parallelization by capturing recurrence sequence with attention and at the same time encodes each item's position in the sequence. As a result, Transformer leads to a compatible model with significantly shorter training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the seq2seq model in :numref:`sec_seq2seq`, Transformer is also based on the encoder-decoder architecture. However,  Transformer differs to the former by replacing the\n",
    "recurrent layers in seq2seq with *multi-head attention* layers, incorporating the position-wise information through *position encoding*, and applying *layer normalization*. \n",
    "We  compare  Transformer  and seq2seq  side-by-side in :numref:`fig_transformer`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these two models are similar to each other: the source sequence embeddings are fed into $n$ repeated blocks. The outputs of the last block are then used as attention memory for the decoder.  The target sequence embeddings are similarly fed into $n$ repeated blocks in the decoder, and the final outputs are obtained by applying a dense layer with vocabulary size to the last block's outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the flip side, Transformer differs from the seq2seq with attention model in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transformer block**: a recurrent layer in seq2seq is replaced by a *Transformer block*. This block contains a *multi-head attention* layer and a network with two *position-wise feed-forward network* layers for the encoder. For the decoder, another multi-head attention layer is used to take the encoder state.\n",
    "1. **Add and norm**: the inputs and outputs of both the multi-head attention layer or the position-wise feed-forward network, are processed by two \"add and norm\" layer that contains a residual structure and a *layer normalization* layer.\n",
    "1. **Position encoding**: since the self-attention layer does not distinguish the item order in a sequence, a positional encoding layer is used to add sequential information into each sequence item.\n",

    "## Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the discussion of the *multi-head attention* layer, let's quick express the *self-attention* architecture. The self-attention model is a normal attention model, with its query, its key, and its value being copied exactly the same from each item of the sequential inputs. As we illustrate in :numref:`fig_self_attention`, self-attention outputs a same-length sequential output for each input item. Compared with a recurrent layer, output items of a self-attention layer can be computed in parallel and, therefore, it is easy to obtain a highly-efficient implementation.\n",

    ":label:`fig_self_attention`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The *multi-head attention* layer consists of $h$ parallel self-attention layers, each one is called a *head*. For each head, before feeding into the attention layer, we project the queries, keys, and values with three dense layers with hidden sizes $p_q$, $p_k$, and $p_v$, respectively. The outputs of these $h$ attention heads are concatenated and then processed by a final dense layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Multi-head attention](../img/multi-head-attention.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the dimension for a query, a key, and a value are $d_q$, $d_k$, and $d_v$, respectively. Then, for each head $i=1,\\ldots, h$, we can train learnable parameters \n",
    "$\\mathbf W_q^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb R^{p_q\\times d_q}$,\n",
    "$\\mathbf W_k^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb R^{p_k\\times d_k}$,\n",
    "and $\\mathbf W_v^{(i)}\\in\\mathbb R^{p_v\\times d_v}$. Therefore, the output for each head is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf o^{(i)} = \\textrm{attention}(\\mathbf W_q^{(i)}\\mathbf q, \\mathbf W_k^{(i)}\\mathbf k,\\mathbf W_v^{(i)}\\mathbf v),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\textrm{attention}$ can be any attention layer, such as the `DotProductAttention` and `MLPAttention` as we introduced in :label:`sec_attention`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the output with length $p_v$ from each of the $h$ attention heads are concatenated to be an output of length $h p_v$, which is then passed the final dense layer with $d_o$ hidden units. The weights of this dense layer can be denoted by $\\mathbf W_o\\in\\mathbb R^{d_o\\times h p_v}$. As a result, the multi-head attention output will be\n",

    "$$\\mathbf o = \\mathbf W_o \\begin{bmatrix}\\mathbf o^{(1)}\\\\\\vdots\\\\\\mathbf o^{(h)}\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can implement the multi-head attention. Assume that the multi-head attention contain the number heads `num_heads` $=h$, the hidden size `hidden_size` $=p_q=p_k=p_v$ are the same for the query,  key, and value dense layers. In addition, since the multi-head attention keeps the same dimensionality between its input and its output, we have the output feature size $d_o = $ `hidden_size` as well."

One difference is that the mean and variances for the layer normalization are calculated along the last dimension, e.g `X.mean(axis=-1)` instead of the first batch dimension, e.g., `X.mean(axis=0)`.
