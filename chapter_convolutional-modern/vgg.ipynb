    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* VGG-11 constructs a network using reusable convolutional blocks. Different VGG models can be defined by the differences in the number of convolutional layers and output channels in each block.\n",
    "* The use of blocks leads to very compact representations of the network definition. It allows for efficient design of complex networks.\n",
    "* In their work Simonyan and Ziserman experimented with various architectures. In particular, they found that several layers of deep and narrow convolutions (i.e., $3 \\times 3$) were more effective than fewer layers of wider convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When printing out the dimensions of the layers we only saw 8 results rather than 11. Where did the remaining 3 layer informations go?\n",
    "1. Compared with AlexNet, VGG is much slower in terms of computation, and it also needs more GPU memory. Try to analyze the reasons for this.\n",
    "1. Try to change the height and width of the images in Fashion-MNIST from 224 to 96. What influence does this have on the experiments?\n",
    "1. Refer to Table 1 in :cite:`Simonyan.Zisserman.2014` to construct other common models, such as VGG-16 or VGG-19.\n",
