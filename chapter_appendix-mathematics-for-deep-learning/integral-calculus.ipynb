    "Looking closely, we see that this is similar to the single variable chain rule :eqref:`eq_change_var`, except we have replaced the term $\\frac{du}{dx}(x)$ with $\\left|\\det(D\\phi(\\mathbf{x}))\\right|$.  Let's see how we can to interpret this term.  Recall that the $\\frac{du}{dx}(x)$ term existed to say how much we stretched our $x$-axis by applying $u$.  The same process in higher dimensions is to determine how much we stretch the area (or volume, or hyper-volume) of a little square (or little *hyper-cube*) by applying $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$.  If $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$ was the multiplication by a matrix, then we know how the determinant already gives the answer.  \n",

    "With some work, one can show that the *Jacobian* provides the best approximation to a multivariable function $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$ at a point by a matrix in the same way we could approximate by lines or planes with derivatives and gradients. Thus the determinant of the Jacobian exactly mirrors the scaling factor we identified in one dimension.\n",

    "* The theory of integration allows us to answer questions about areas or volumes.\n",
    "* The fundamental theorem of calculus allows us to leverage knowledge about derivatives to compute areas via the observation that the derivative of the area up to some point is given by the value of the function being integrated.\n",
    "* Integrals in higher dimensions can be computed by iterating single variable integrals.\n",
